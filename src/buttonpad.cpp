  //     matching Release at all.
  //   * handleTimer() (src/keyarray.cpp:68-75) re-reads the matrix one second
  //     after the Press. If a second key is touched by then the scan returns a
  //     different code, so it takes the else branch and clears buttonState to
  //     {0, BS_NONE} WITHOUT emitting anything. The eventual handleRelease()
  //     then emits BS_RELEASED against that cleared `button` - i.e. button 0,
  //     not the arrow - and codeToKey() drops it. The arrow's Release never
  //     arrives.
  //     (The same else branch also fires with no second key if the contact is
